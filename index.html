The Clemente Lab is part of the <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics">Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences</a> and the <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/immunology-institute">Immunology Institute</a> at <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu">Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</a> in New York City. We are broadly interested in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly with a focus on characterizing the microbiome in human subjects and in the environment.
