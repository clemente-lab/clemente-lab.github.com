Since we're a lab focused on the computational side of biology, we have several
bioinformatics software packages that we've either developed directly in our
lab or in conjunction with other bioinformatics labs.

## QIIME [Website](http://www.qiime.org) | [GitHub](https://github.com/qiime/qiime)

QIIME (**Q**uantitative **I**nsights **I**nto **M**icrobial **E**cology) is an open source software
package for the comparison and analysis of microbial communities, taking users
from their raw sequencing data through publication-quality graphics.

## PyCogent [Website](http://www.pycogent.org) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pycogent/pycogent)

PyCogent (**P**ython **CO**mparative **GEN**omic **T**oolkit) is an open source
software library that provides a wide variety of functionality for the
manipulation and analysis of genome biology data sets.

## BIOM Format [Website](http://www.biom-format.org) | [GitHub](https://github.com/biom-format/biom-format)

The BIOM Format (**BI**ological **O**bservation **M**atrix Format) is a
JSON-based file format for storing general sample by observation contingency
tables. In addition to the format itself, an API is provided in multiple
programming languages to support the use of the format in bioinformatics
software.

## PICRUSt [Website](http://picrust.github.io/picrust/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/picrust/picrust)

PICRUSt (**P**hylogenetic **I**nvestigation of **C**ommunities by
**R**econstruction of **U**nobserved **St**ates) is a bioinformatics software
package designed to predict metagenome functional content from marker gene
(e.g., 16S rRNA) surveys and full genomes.
